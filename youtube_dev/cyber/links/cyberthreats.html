              <h2 class="hightlight_boi">Where Do Cyber Threats Come From?</h2>     
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Hostile Nation-States</h2>
            <p>
              ‍National cyber warfare programs provide emerging cyber threats ranging from propaganda, website defacement, espionage, disruption of key infrastructure to loss of life. Government-sponsored programs are increasingly sophisticated and pose advanced threats when compared to other threat actors. Their developing capabilities could cause widespread, long-term damages to the national security of many countries including the United States. Hostile nation-states pose the highest risk due to their ability to effectively employ technology and tools against the most difficult targets like classified networks and critical infrastructure like electricity grids and gas control valves.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Terrorist Groups</h2>
            <p>
              ‍Terrorist groups are increasingly using cyber attacks to damage national interests. They are less developed in cyber attacks and have a lower propensity to pursue cyber means than nation-states. It is likely that terrorist groups will present substantial cyber threats as more technically competent generations join their ranks.


            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Corporate Spies and Organized Crime Organizations</h2>
            <p>
              ‍Corporate spies and organized crime organizations pose a risk due to their ability to conduct industrial espionage to steal trade secrets or large-scale monetary theft. Generally, these parties are interested in profit based activities, either making a profit or disrupting a business's ability to make a profit by attacking key infrastructure of competitors, stealing trade secrets, or gaining access and blackmail material.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Hacktivists</h2>
            <p>
              ‍Hacktivists activities range across political ideals and issues. Most hacktivist groups are concerned with spreading propaganda rather than damaging infrastructure or disrupting services. Their goal is to support their political agenda rather than cause maximum damage to an organization.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Disgruntled Insiders

            </h2>
            <p>
              ‍Disgruntled insiders are a common source of cyber crime. Insiders often don't need a high degree of computer knowledge to expose sensitive data because they may be authorized to access the data. Insider threats also include third-party vendors and employees who may accidentally introduce malware into systems or may log into a secure S3 bucket, download its contents and share it online resulting in a data breach. Check your S3 permissions or someone else will.

            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Hackers

            </h2>
            <p>
              Malicious intruders could take advantage of a zero-day exploit to gain unauthorized access to data. Hackers may break into information systems for a challenge or bragging rights. In the past, this required a high level of skill. Today, automated attack scripts and protocols can be downloaded from the Internet, making sophisticated attacks simple.

            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Natural Disasters

            </h2>
            <p>
              ‍Natural disasters represent a cyber threat because they can disrupt your key infrastructure just like a cyber attack could.
