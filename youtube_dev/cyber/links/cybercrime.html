            <br>
                <p>
                  While most companies have IT teams or hire security specialists to protect themselves against cybercrime, consumers are generally on their own. The pandemic pushed many people to spend long hours online for work, shopping and entertainment—a trend likely to continue—and that expansion led to vulnerability. More than 155.8 million people were affected by data breaches in 2020.

            <h2 class="subfields_style">1. Opt For Automatic Software Updates</h2>
            <p>
              To help protect their devices from cybercrime, consumers should make sure to turn on automatic updates for all software, especially for frequently used browsers and apps. Many people forget to update manually. Hackers target weaknesses in programs that can later be fixed with a patch or update—but only if the consumer keeps their software current. This reduces new threats. - Susan Lang, XIL Health, LLC

            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">2. Stay Skeptical</h2>
            <p>
              Maintain a healthy degree of skepticism about everything you receive from digital sources, whether it’s via email, a text message, chat messages or even a good old-fashioned telephone call. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If it comes with an urgent call to action, why? Much of cybercrime today leverages these forms of phishing attacks, so awareness is at least as important as technology. - Andrew Hollister, LogRhythm

            <h2 class="subfields_style">3. Never Reuse Passwords</h2>
            <p>
              Use unique passwords for every website. Otherwise, if one website is compromised, the same credentials could be used to authenticate to other services. Of course, no one would be able to remember all these passwords without a password manager. Luckily there are many services out there that are all better than using the same password all over the internet. - Gerrit Rindermann, Lambs

            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">4. Use A Password Manager</h2>
            <p>
              Passwords are the critical piece because consumers end up reusing them. This practice can be easily avoided by using a password manager. There are several good open-source options out there that are safe. In addition to generating strong passwords, they also enable you to use two-factor authentication, which makes hacking an account much harder. - Jonah Kowall, Logz.io

            <h2 class="subfields_style">5. Leverage Google Authenticator

            </h2>
            <p>
              A great place to start is to think about credentials. A couple of tools I would recommend everyone use daily are Google Authenticator, which allows you to have multifactor and adaptive authentication to commonly used services such as Gmail and Instagram, and password vaulting programs, which are critical when looking at the gravity of credential-based attacks. - Stephen Moore, Exabeam
