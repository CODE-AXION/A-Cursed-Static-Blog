                  There have been several stumbling blocks to creating a clear and consistent definition of the
                  term “cyberterrorism.” First, as just noted, much of the discussion of cyberterrorism has been
                  conducted in the popular media, where journalists typically strive for drama and sensation
                  rather than for good operational definitions of new terms. Second, it has been especially
                  common when dealing with computers to coin new words simply by placing the word “cyber,”
                  “computer,” or “information” before another word. Thus, an entire arsenal of words—cybercrime, infowar, netwar, cyberterrorism, cyberharassment, virtual warfare, digital terrorism,
                  cybertactics, computer warfare, cyberattack, and cyber-break-ins—is used to describe what
                  some military and political strategists describe as the “new terrorism” of our times.
                  Fortunately, some efforts have been made to introduce greater semantic precision.
                  Most notably, Dorothy Denning, a professor of computer science, has put forward an admirably unambiguous definition in numerous articles and in her testimony on the subject
                  before the House Armed Services Committee in May 2000:

              Cyberterrorism is the convergence of cyberspace and terrorism. It refers to unlawful
attacks and threats of attacks against computers, networks and the information
stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in
furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism,
an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause
enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical
infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks
that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not

            <h2 class="subfields_style">The Appeal of Cyberterrorism for Terrorists</h2>
            <p>
              Cyberterrorism is an attractive option for modern terrorists for several reasons.
              • First, it is cheaper than traditional terrorist methods. All that the terrorist needs is a
              personal computer and an online connection. Terrorists do not need to buy weapons
              such as guns and explosives; instead, they can create and deliver computer viruses
              through a telephone line, a cable, or a wireless connection.
              • Second, cyberterrorism is more anonymous than traditional terrorist methods. Like
              many Internet surfers, terrorists use online nicknames—”screen names”—or log on
              to a website as an unidentified “guest user,” making it very hard for security agencies
              and police forces to track down the terrorists’ real identity. And in cyberspace there
              are no physical barriers such as checkpoints to navigate, no borders to cross, and no
              customs agents to outsmart.
              • Third, the variety and number of targets are enormous. The cyberterrorist could target
              the computers and computer networks of governments, individuals, public utilities,
              private airlines, and so forth. The sheer number and complexity of potential targets
              guarantee that terrorists can find weaknesses and vulnerabilities to exploit. Several
              studies have shown that critical infrastructures, such as electric power grids and emergency services, are vulnerable to a cyberterrorist attack because the infrastructures
              and the computer systems that run them are highly complex, making it effectively
              impossible to eliminate all weaknesses.
              • Fourth, cyberterrorism can be conducted remotely, a feature that is especially appealing to terrorists. Cyberterrorism requires less physical training, psychological investment, risk of mortality, and travel than conventional forms of terrorism, making it
              easier for terrorist organizations to recruit and retain followers.
              • Fifth, as the I LOVE YOU virus showed, cyberterrorism has the potential to affect
              directly a larger number of people than traditional terrorist methods, thereby generating greater media coverage, which is ultimately what terrorists want

            <h2 class="subfields_style">A Growing Sense of Vulnerability</h2>
            <p>
              Black Ice: The Invisible Threat of Cyber-Terror, a book published in 2003 and written by
Computerworld journalist and former intelligence officer Dan Verton, describes the 1997
exercise code-named “Eligible Receiver,” conducted by the National Security Agency
(NSA). (The following account draws from “Black Ice,” Computerworld, August 13, 2003.)
The exercise began when NSA officials instructed a “Red Team” of thirty-five hackers to
attempt to hack into and disrupt U.S. national security systems. They were told to play
the part of hackers hired by the North Korean intelligence service, and their primary target was to be the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii. They were allowed to penetrate any
Pentagon network but were prohibited from breaking any U.S. laws, and they could only
use hacking software that could be downloaded freely from the Internet. They started
mapping networks and obtaining passwords gained through “brute-force cracking” (a
trial-and-error method of decoding encrypted data such as passwords or encryption keys
by trying all possible combinations). Often they used simpler tactics such as calling
somebody on the telephone, pretending to be a technician or high-ranking official, and
asking for the password. The hackers managed to gain access to dozens of critical Pentagon computer systems. Once they entered the systems, they could easily create user
accounts, delete existing accounts, reformat hard drives, scramble stored data, or shut
systems down. They broke the network defenses with relative ease and did so without
being traced or identified by the authorities.

            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Is the Cyberterror Threat Exaggerated?</h2>
            <p>
              Amid all the dire warnings and alarming statistics that the subject of cyberterrorism generates, it is important to remember one simple statistic: so far, there has been no recorded
instance of a terrorist cyberattack on U.S. public facilities, transportation systems, nuclear
power plants, power grids, or other key components of the national infrastructure. Cyberattacks are common, but they have not been conducted by terrorists and they have not
sought to inflict the kind of damage that would qualify them as cyberterrorism.
Technological expertise and use of the Internet do not constitute evidence of planning for
a cyberattack. Joshua Green (“The Myth of Cyberterrorism,” Washington Monthly, November
2002) makes this point after reviewing the data retrieved from terrorists in Afghanistan:
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">Cyberterrorism Today and Tomorrow</h2>
            <p>
              It seems fair to say that the current threat posed by cyberterrorism has been exaggerated.
              No single instance of cyberterrorism has yet been recorded; U.S. defense and intelligence
              computer systems are air-gapped and thus isolated from the Internet; the systems run by
              10
              As Green argues, the employees of companies that handle
              power grids, oil and gas utilities,
              and communications are well
              rehearsed in dealing with the
              fallout from hurricanes, floods,
              tornadoes, and other natural
              disasters. They are also equally
              adept at containing and remedying problems that stem from
              human action.
              private companies are more vulnerable to attack but also more resilient than is often supposed; the vast majority of cyberattacks are launched by hackers with few, if any, political
              goals and no desire to cause the mayhem and carnage of which terrorists dream. So, then,
              why has so much concern been expressed over a relatively minor threat?
              The reasons are many. First, as Denning has observed, “cyberterrorism and cyberattacks are sexy right now. . . . [Cyberterrorism is] novel, original, it captures people’s
              imagination.” Second, the mass media frequently fail to distinguish between hacking and
              cyberterrorism and exaggerate the threat of the latter by reasoning from false analogies
              such as the following: “If a sixteen-year-old could do this, then what could a well-funded
              terrorist group do?” Ignorance is a third factor. Green argues that cyberterrorism merges
              two spheres—terrorism and technology—that many people, including most lawmakers
              and senior administration officials, do not fully understand and therefore tend to fear.
              Moreover, some groups are eager to exploit this ignorance. Numerous technology companies, still reeling from the collapse of the high-tech bubble, have sought to attract
              federal research grants by recasting themselves as innovators in computer security and
              thus vital contributors to national security. Law enforcement and security consultants
              are likewise highly motivated to have us believe that the threat to our nation’s security
              is severe. A fourth reason is that some politicians, whether out of genuine conviction
              or out of a desire to stoke public anxiety about terrorism in order to advance their own
              agendas, have played the role of prophets of doom. And a fifth factor is ambiguity about
              the very meaning of “cyberterrorism,” which has confused the public and given rise to
              countless myths.
              Verton argues that “al Qaeda [has] shown itself to have an incessant appetite for modern technology” and provides numerous citations from bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders to show their recognition of this new cyberweapon. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks,
              bin Laden reportedly gave a statement to an editor of an Arab newspaper claiming that
              “hundreds of Muslim scientists were with him who would use their knowledge . . . ranging from computers to electronics against the infidels.” Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad,
              a supporter of bin Laden and often the conduit for his messages to the Western world,
              declared in an interview with Verton, “I would advise those who doubt al Qaeda’s interest
              in cyber-weapons to take Osama bin Laden very seriously. The third letter from Osama bin
              Laden . . . was clearly addressing using the technology in order to destroy the economy
              of the capitalist states.”
