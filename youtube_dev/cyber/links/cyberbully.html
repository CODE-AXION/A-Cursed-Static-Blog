              <h2 class="hightlight_boi">1. Am I being bullied online? How do you tell the difference between a joke and bullying?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  UNICEF: 
                  All friends joke around with each other, but sometimes it’s hard to tell if someone is just having fun or trying to hurt you, especially online. Sometimes they’ll laugh it off with a “just kidding,” or “don’t take it so seriously.” 
            </p>     
               <br>
               <br>          
           
            <p>
              But if you feel hurt or think others are laughing at you instead of with you, then the joke has gone too far. If it continues even after you’ve asked the person to stop and you are still feeling upset about it, then this could be bullying.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              And when the bullying takes place online, it can result in unwanted attention from a wide range of people including strangers. Wherever it may happen, if you are not happy about it, you should not have to stand for it.

Call it what you will – if you feel bad and it doesn’t stop, then it’s worth getting help. Stopping cyberbullying is not just about calling out bullies, it’s also about recognizing that everyone deserves respect – online and in real life.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies. It can take place on social media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms and mobile phones. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. Examples include:

spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos or videos of someone on social media
sending hurtful, abusive or threatening messages, images or videos via messaging platforms
impersonating someone and sending mean messages to others on their behalf or through fake accounts.
Face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying can often happen alongside each other. But cyberbullying leaves a digital footprint – a record that can prove useful and provide evidence to help stop the abuse.

            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">2. What are the effects of cyberbullying?</h2>
            <p>
              UNICEF:
              When bullying happens online it can feel as if you’re being attacked everywhere, even inside your own home. It can seem like there’s no escape. The effects can last a long time and affect a person in many ways:
              
              Mentally – feeling upset, embarrassed, stupid, even afraid or angry 
              Emotionally – feeling ashamed or losing interest in the things you love
              Physically – tired (loss of sleep), or experiencing symptoms like stomach aches and headaches 
              The feeling of being laughed at or harassed by others, can prevent people from speaking up or trying to deal with the problem. In extreme cases, cyberbullying can even lead to people taking their own lives. 
              
              Cyberbullying can affect us in many ways. But these can be overcome and people can regain their confidence and health.
              
              
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">3. How can cyberbullying affect my mental health?</h2>
            <p>
              UNICEF:
              When you experience cyberbullying you might start to feel ashamed, nervous, anxious and insecure about what people say or think about you. This can lead to withdrawing from friends and family, negative thoughts and self-talk, feeling guilty about things you did or did not do, or feeling that you are being judged negatively. Feeling lonely, overwhelmed, frequent headaches, nausea or stomachaches are also common.
              
              You can lose your motivation to do the things that you usually enjoy doing and feel isolated from the people you love and trust. This can perpetuate negative feelings and thoughts which can adversely affect your mental health and well-being.
              
              Skipping school is another common effect of cyberbullying and can affect the mental health of young people who turn to substances like alcohol and drugs or violent behavior to deal with their psychological and physical pain. Talking to a friend, family member or school counsellor you trust can be a first step to getting help.
              
              The effects of cyberbullying on mental health can vary depending on the medium through which it happens. For example, bullying via text messaging or through pictures or videos on social media platforms has proven to be very harmful for adolescents.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subfields_style">4. Who should I talk to if someone is bullying me online? Why is reporting important?</h2>
            <p>
              UNICEF: 
              If you think you’re being bullied, the first step is to seek help from someone you trust such as your parents, a close family member or another trusted adult.
              
              In your school you can reach out to a counsellor, the sports coach or your favourite teacher – either online or in person.
              
              And if you are not comfortable talking to someone you know, search for a helpline in your country to talk to a professional counsellor.
              
              If the bullying is happening on a social platform, consider blocking the bully and formally reporting their behaviour on the platform itself. Social media companies are obligated to keep their users safe.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              It can be helpful to collect evidence – text messages and screen shots of social media posts – to show what’s been going on.

For bullying to stop, it needs to be identified and reporting it is key. It can also help to show the bully that their behaviour is unacceptable.

If you are in immediate danger, then you should contact the police or emergency services in your country.
